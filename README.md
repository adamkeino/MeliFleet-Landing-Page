# The Odin Project Landing Page 
This repo is dedicated to my submission for the odin project landing page.  
My project involves the development of a fleet management platform where a user can be able to monitor the various aspects of their fleet in terms of:
- Fuel management
- GPS tracking 
- Loading monitoring
- Speed monitoring
- Fleet cost monitoring
- Fleet personnel management  
I have labelled my fleet management system the Meli Fleet Management.  
This Project has allowed me to learn quite a lot in terms of front-end web app development with HTML and CSS.  
And as I learn more and more, I will be applying my new skill set in fleshing out this project further.  
And maybe one day, I can secure the financial resources to deploy this as a real-world fleet management solution.  
*Here's to the future!!!*
